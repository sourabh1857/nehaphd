4. **"Solution"**
   - *"A Comprehensive Solution for Enhanced and Secure Local Storage in Kubernetes"*
   - Business-oriented but academically acceptable

5. **"Methodology"** (if process-focused)
   - *"A Novel Methodology for Enhanced and Secure Local Storage in Kubernetes"*
   - Good if your contribution includes new processes/methods

#### **More Specific Technical Terms:**

6. **"Engine"**
   - *"An Intelligent Storage Engine for Enhanced and Secure Local Storage in Kubernetes"*
   - Implies active processing and optimization

7. **"Orchestrator"**
   - *"A Storage Orchestrator for Enhanced and Secure Local Storage in Kubernetes"*
   - Fits well with Kubernetes terminology

8. **"Controller"**
   - *"An Advanced Storage Controller for Enhanced and Secure Local Storage in Kubernetes"*
   - Aligns with Kubernetes controller patterns

## Detailed Framework Design Clarity

### Phase 2: Framework Design Breakdown

#### 2.1 Requirements Analysis & Architecture Design
**What you're actually designing:**
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
  - Automated performance optimization

  - High availability and fault tolerance
  - Security compliance standards

- **System Architecture**: The overall structure
  - Microservices-based design
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Plugin-based extensibility
  - Cloud-native patterns

#### 2.2 Performance Enhancement Components
**Core Algorithms & Mechanisms:**
- **Intelligent Caching Algorithm**: Multi-tier caching with ML-based prediction

## Academic Contribution Clarity

Your framework represents:

1. **Novel Technical Contribution**: New algorithms and methods for storage optimization
2. **System Integration**: Comprehensive solution addressing multiple aspects
3. **Practical Implementation**: Working prototype with real-world applicability
4. **Research Validation**: Empirical evidence of effectiveness through testing

## Recommendation

**I recommend using "Architecture"** as it:
- Is academically appropriate for PhD-level research
- Clearly indicates systematic design approach
- Encompasses both technical and conceptual contributions
- Aligns with computer science research terminology

**Suggested Title:**
*"A Comprehensive Architecture for Performance Enhancement and Security of Local Storage in Kubernetes"*

This title clearly communicates:
- The scope (comprehensive)
- The contribution type (architecture)
- The dual focus (performance + security)
- The specific domain (Kubernetes local storage)

Would you like me to update your roadmap documents with the new terminology?
